## 1.19.2 - 3.6.0
- 1.19 update

## 1.18.2 - 3.5.1
- Merged the changes from 1.16.5 - 3.4.4
- Titles no longer disappear on death in newer 1.18. Fixes #39
- Titles now display next to the player's name in the playerlist on servers. This can be disabled in the config
- Titles can now be prefixed to a player name instead of only suffixed
- Titles now has native nickname functionality! Due to how FTB Essentials does its nickname (using PlayerInfo instead of the PlayerEvent.TabListNameFormat event), there was no way for me to properly update the tablist name, nor would I be able to show the nickname in the title selection GUI. Adding my own nickname solves this. Fixes #40

## 1.18.2 - 3.5.0
- Update to 1.18. No new features as of yet
- Did change the y-level for the Spelunker advancement/title to -20 to 0, from 0 to 20 to account for the underground changes
- The "/titles display" command now only lists the titles you have unlocked, instead of all titles
- Added new title for the "Cave & Cliffs" advancement, "the Base Jumper"
- Added a new advancement and associated title, "the Frigid"

## 1.16.5 - 3.4.4
- Can now properly "remove" titles by using datapacks, just like advancements. Fixes #37
- Some minor refactoring

## 1.16.5 - 3.4.3
- Finally solved that title syncing issue. Fixes #32, fixes #34

## 1.16.5 - 3.4.2
- Fixed an error caused by advancements whose title was plain text rather than a translatable lang entry

## 1.16.5 - 3.4.1

## 1.16.5 - 3.4.0
- Refactored nearly every class. Probably includes some performance improvement, but was done primarily for flow and readability.
- Removed most of the API. I kept the Title and TitleProvider classes so modders can add their own titles, but I wasn't sure if the rest of it was even being used.
- Flavor text has now been implemented. Hovering over an underlined title will show a tooltip with its flavor text.
- I've added template title packs for Botania, Immersive Engineering, and Twilight Forest as they were very popular and ones I am familiar with. Template just means they are there to show what this mod is capable of. Once the actual mods add their own, mine will be removed.
- Commands were broken for a while - they now work properly.

## 1.16.5 - 3.3.2
- Fixes a bug where unlocking titles on a server won't update until they are also unlocked in single player (#26)

## 1.16.5 - 3.3.1
- Added a new command to set your display title. It's a faster way to change your display title if you know what you are looking for, but also has uses in quest mods.
- You can now change your display title to one you just earned from an advancement by clicking on it in the chat message (it uses the command from above).
- Added a new contributor "mythic" rarity for a new, higher tier Patreon reward

## 1.16.5 - 3.3.0
- Reworked how title data is stored and loaded. It is still a json oriented system, but now each title must have its own json. Similar to how vanilla does advancements and recipes.
- Added a Title data provider and a builder class in the API for modders to easily generate titles for their mods.
- There is a new command called "/titles refresh". This will go clear the player's earned titles, and then re-award titles for their completed advancements.
- Villager title scroll trades are no longer added if the fragment loot config options is set to false.

## 1.16.5 - 3.2.6
- Changed the Shieldbearer title slightly to Shield Bearer
- Also added its feminine variant: Shield Maiden
- Added a new title for the "This Boat has Legs" advancement: the Strider Rider

## 1.16.5 - 3.2.5
- Fixed another server crash caused by calling client-only code
- Added a feminine variant for "the Huntsman" title: "the Huntress"
- Made it easier for modpack makers to add titles. Just modify the files in data/titles/titles (not the example ones)
- For right now, feminine variants cannot be done with data loaded titles. This will be added later.

## 1.16.4 - 3.2.4
- Fixed a crash caused by calling the wrong method on the server

## 1.16.4 - 3.2.3

## 1.12.2 - 3.1.7
- Now properly syncs title data on respawn and dimension changes. How this wasn't reported sooner, I have no idea.

## 1.12.2 - 3.1.6
- Improved pattern matching to prevent errors with mods with weird lang file entries for advancements.

## 1.12.2 - 3.1.5
- Renamed es_es.lang to es_ES.lang so Minecraft would recognize it

## 1.12.2 - 3.1.4
- Somehow I deleted the @SubscribeEvent annotation from the method that updates the player's name. Derp.

## 1.12.2 - 3.1.3
- Added es_es.lang (Thanks Alfkors!)
- Added a command to load advancement-based titles in existing worlds (/titles refresh)
- Added a config option to disable archive fragments being added to loot
- Removed the config option to change rarity colors. There was just no good way to make it update in chat as well.
- Note: this may comeback in 1.15, but we'll see

## 1.12.2 - 3.1.2

## 1.12.2 - 3.1.0

- For modpack makers: titles available in the Archive are loaded from archiveTitles.json, which is in the config directory

## 1.12.2 - 2.1.0
- Added a page counter to the title selection GUI
- Added missing mcmod.info file
- Players can now change the color for each type of title through the config (common, uncommon, rare, unique)
- You are only able to choose from the lighter chat colors due to text drop shadow
- On the backend, title data is now a capability. Was player NBT data.
