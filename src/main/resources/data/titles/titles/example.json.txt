  // WARNING: If you copy this entire file to your own json, be sure to remove all the lines that begin with "//" or else your titles won't appear.
  // For advancement-unlocked titles, the name of this json must match the advancement's resource location.
  // For example, to make a title for the advancement "mine_stone", there must be a subfolder in the "titles" folder called
  // "story", with a title json also called "mine_stone". You can find further examples in this mod's data folder, or
  // the source code available here: https://github.com/Aurilux/Titles/tree/master/src/main/resources/data/titles/titles;

  // This value determines how the title can be unlocked. There are three options:
  // "advancement": The title will automatically be unlocked when the player completes the associated advancement.
  // "loot": The title can only be obtained by purchasing it from villagers or defeating Titled mobs
  // "command": The title can only be unlocked using the "/titles add" command. Good for quest mods or other rewards.
  // "starting": The title is available to all players by default.
  "type": "loot",

  // Whether the title is rendered before or after the player's name. This boolean value is an optional entry, and if it
  // doesn't appear in the json, will be assumed to be false.
  "isPrefix": "false",

  // The rarity of the title, matching vanilla's rarity values (common, uncommon, rare). Epic rarity is reserved for
  // contributors and will be defaulted to common if put as a value here.
  // For advancement-unlocked titles, normal advancements should be common, goal should be uncommon, and challenge should be rare.
  // I can't enforce this pattern (at least not yet), but I encourage you to follow it.
  "rarity": "common",

  // What is displayed next to the player's name. Titles will try to translate the value to the current language, so you
  // can give it a lang value,  e.x. "default": "titles.title.tester". Or you can give it a direct value like below.
  // I suggest modders use lang translations to make it easier on translators, while modpack makers can use direct values
  // since it would be easier for them.
  "defaultDisplay": "The Tester",

  // For gendered languages, this follows the same rules as defaultDisplay. While default is considered the masculine/neutral
  // translation, this is for feminine variants. This is an optional entry and does not have to be in the json.
  // Yes, this is a subtle Loki reference.
  "variantDisplay": "The Testeress",

  // Also an optional entry, this is just flavor text that gets displayed under the title itself in the title
  // selection screen.
  "flavorText": "How much testing could a tester test, if a tester could test tests?"
